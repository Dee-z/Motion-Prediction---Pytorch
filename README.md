# Motion-Prediction
This is implemented for moving object prediction; using CNN, GAN and LSTM

This is implemented on Moving MNIST dataset. To create this dataset, please reference ./data prepare/moving_mnist.py. Or you can download Moving MNIST from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sx3r94Cce9Mf8v2Hv9H3k6zvKLm7SdQK/view?usp=sharing)

The network is trained using Pytorch and Colab (free GPU of Google)

You could find the results in ./Main.ipynb
